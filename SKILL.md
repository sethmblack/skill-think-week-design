# Think Week Design

Design and execute structured deep-thinking retreats for strategic clarity, incorporating Gates's methodology for isolated reading and synthesis.

---

## When to Use

- Facing major strategic decisions requiring deep thought
- Need to learn a new domain thoroughly before making decisions
- Feeling overwhelmed by operational demands and losing strategic perspective
- User asks "Design a Think Week for me" or "I need strategic thinking time"

---

## Inputs

| Input | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| strategic_questions | Yes | The key questions or decisions to address |
| available_time | Yes | Days or hours available for retreat |
| domains | No | Specific topics or areas to explore |
| constraints | No | Location options, connectivity needs |

---

## Gates's Think Week Methodology

Bill Gates has practiced Think Weeks since the 1990s—twice-yearly retreats where he isolates himself completely to read, think, and write strategic memos.

### Core Principles

1. **Complete Isolation:** No email, no meetings, no operational decisions. "That's CPU time."

2. **Curated Input:** A carefully selected stack of books, papers, and strategic documents. Not random browsing—intentional selection.

3. **Extended Time Blocks:** Serious reading requires serious time. Gates reads for hours at a stretch, not in snippets.

4. **Active Synthesis:** Reading with note-taking, connecting ideas, writing memos. Not passive consumption.

5. **Strategic Output:** The goal is clarity and direction—memos that shape future decisions.

### Famous Outcomes

Gates's 1995 "Internet Tidal Wave" memo—which redirected Microsoft's entire strategy toward the web—emerged from Think Week reflection. The practice isn't self-indulgence; it's strategy generation.

## Workflow

### Step 1: Gather and Review Inputs

Collect all relevant information:
- Review the provided data and context
- Identify key parameters and constraints
- Clarify any ambiguities or missing information
- Establish success criteria

### Step 2: Analyze the Situation

Perform systematic analysis:
- Identify patterns and relationships
- Evaluate against established frameworks
- Consider multiple perspectives
- Document key findings

### Step 3: Generate Recommendations

Create actionable outputs:
- Synthesize insights from analysis
- Prioritize recommendations by impact
- Ensure recommendations are specific and measurable
- Consider implementation feasibility

```

## Think Week Variants

### Full Gates (7 Days)
- Complete isolation in dedicated location
- 50+ hours of reading time
- Major strategic direction setting
- Best for: Founders, CEOs facing inflection points

### Modified Gates (3-4 Days)
- Near-complete isolation
- 25-35 hours of reading time
- Significant strategic questions
- Best for: Executives, team leads with strategic decisions

### Intensive Think Days (1-2 Days)
- Focused isolation (no isolation overnight)
- 10-18 hours of reading time
- Single strategic question or domain
- Best for: Managers, individual contributors, first-time practice

### Think Mornings (Weekly)
- 3-4 hour protected blocks
- Ongoing strategic reading practice
- Cumulative synthesis over time
- Best for: Building the habit before attempting full retreat

---

## Reading Selection Principles

### The Multi-Source Rule
Gates doesn't read one book on a topic—he reads five. Selection should include:

1. **The canonical work** - The definitive or foundational text
2. **The practitioner view** - Someone who's done it
3. **The critic** - Someone who disagrees
4. **The adjacent perspective** - Related domain with different lens
5. **The recent synthesis** - Current state of knowledge

### Quality Filters
- Prefer books over articles (deeper thinking)
- Include primary sources where possible
- Balance accessible and challenging material
- Include at least one "uncomfortable" perspective

---

## Outputs

**Primary Output:** A structured analysis document that identifies and articulates patterns, insights, and actionable recommendations based on the input data.

**Format:**
```markdown
## Analysis: [Topic]

### Key Findings
- [Finding 1]
- [Finding 2]
- [Finding 3]

### Recommendations
1. [Action 1]
2. [Action 2]
3. [Action 3]
```

**Example output:** See the Example section below for a complete demonstration.

## Constraints

- Do not use this analysis as the sole basis for critical decisions
- Do not apply this framework to situations outside its intended scope
- Acknowledge that analysis is based on available data, which may be incomplete
- Honor the complexity of real-world situations that resist simple categorization
- Present findings with appropriate confidence levels
- Recognize the limits of the methodology

## Example

**Input:** "I'm a startup CEO. We're deciding whether to raise a Series B or try to reach profitability. I have 3 days available."

**Output:**



**Why this works:**

This example demonstrates the key principles of the skill in action. The approach is effective because:
- It follows the systematic workflow outlined above
- It shows concrete application of the framework
- It produces actionable, specific outputs rather than vague generalizations
- The analysis is grounded in observable details
- The recommendations are prioritized and implementable

**Alternative applications:**

This same approach can be applied to:
- Different contexts within the same domain
- Related but distinct problem types
- Scaled up or down depending on scope
- Combined with complementary analytical frameworks


## Think Week Design

### Strategic Focus
Primary question: Series B vs. path to profitability—which strategic direction best positions us for long-term success?

Secondary questions:
- What's the realistic timeline to profitability?
- What would we do with Series B capital that changes our trajectory?
- What are we optimizing for: growth, control, or optionality?

### Time Structure
- **Duration:** 3 days (Modified Gates format)
- **Format:** Full isolation days, sleep at home
- **Location:** Quiet rental, no WiFi (use phone hotspot for emergencies only)

### Reading Stack

**Core Reading (Must Complete)**
| Title | Author | Why Selected | Time Est. |

| *Rework* | Fried & Hansson | Counter-argument: profitability-first | 3 hrs |
| *Venture Deals* | Feld & Mendelson | Understand what you're negotiating | 5 hrs |
| Your last 12 months of financials | Internal | Ground truth on path to profitability | 2 hrs |
| 3 case studies: similar companies | Research | What happened to others at this inflection | 3 hrs |

**Counter-Position Reading**
| Title | Why Included |
|-------|--------------|
| Blog posts from founders who regret raising | Understand the downside |
| Blog posts from founders who regret not raising | Understand the other downside |

### Daily Structure

**Day 1: Understanding the Landscape**
- Morning (4 hrs): *Venture Deals* chapters on term sheets, board composition, founder control
- Afternoon (4 hrs): Financial analysis—model both paths with realistic assumptions
- Evening (2 hrs): Notes synthesis, refine questions for Day 2

**Day 2: Strategic Options**
- Morning (4 hrs): *Hard Thing About Hard Things* + *Rework*—absorb both perspectives
- Afternoon (4 hrs): Case studies of comparable companies—what actually happened?
- Evening (2 hrs): Draft first version of strategic options memo

**Day 3: Decision Framework**
- Morning (4 hrs): Counter-position reading + fill gaps
- Afternoon (3 hrs): Finalize strategic memo with recommendation
- Evening (1 hr): Outline next steps and stakeholder communication

### Output Deliverables

**Required Outputs:**
1. [ ] Strategic memo: "Series B vs. Profitability Path—Analysis and Recommendation" (4-5 pages)
2. [ ] Financial models for both scenarios (spreadsheet)
3. [ ] Decision criteria framework (1 page)

### Environment Design

**Location:** Airbnb cabin 45 min from home, minimal distractions
**Technology:** Phone in drawer (emergency only), Kindle for reading, laptop for writing/spreadsheets only
**Physical Setup:** Large desk, whiteboard if available, printed financials
**Interruption Protocol:** Co-founder can text "911" if true emergency—nothing else

### The Gates Perspective

Three days won't give you certainty—no amount of reading will. But it will give you clarity about the actual tradeoffs, grounded in how these decisions have played out for others.

The goal isn't to discover the "right" answer. It's to understand the decision well enough that you can make it confidently and execute it fully, rather than half-committing to a path you don't really understand.

That's CPU time. Use it well.
